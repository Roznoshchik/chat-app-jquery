Codeworks Coding Assignment

Hi Rostislav, it was great talking with you today!

Here are the instructions for your coding assignment. Successfully passing this last step completes the Codeworks admission process, which allows you to get enrolled, start the pre course, and join our immersive program.

Remember, it's fine to use tutorials and online resources to help you along the way, but your coding assignment must be your own original code. We take plagiarism very seriously, and we will check if your code is original before accepting your assignment.


Your assignment

Build a simple chat application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.

It’s a page that opens in the browser, and shows the messages in colored bubbles (think something like WhatsApp).

Requirements
 
On one side the computer will generate a random conversation, on the other side the user can post messages.
 
The screen should automatically flow and follow the messages posted, like in all chat apps.
 
Each message should have an indication of the date and time it was sent.
 
Your CSS needs to be clean.
 
Use 3 separate files: one for CSS, one for HTML, and one for JavaScript and jQuery.
 
If your submission contains multiple lines of code taken from any online sources (like code snippets, articles, tutorials, etc.) add a comment citing that work. Copying code without attribution will disqualify you.
 
If you don’t have previous experience with the following technologies, complete these tutorials before starting to work on your assignment.
 
HTML
CSS
Chrome DevTools (only the “CSS”, “DOM”, and “JavaScript” sections)
jQuery

All these lectures are quite short and easy, and will speed up a lot your development process.
 
You are required to submit your code by Jan 25 2022.
 
When you’re done with the assignment, compress all your app assets in a single “.zip” file and use the button below to submit it. 
We will review your code and send you your outcome within 2-3 business days.
