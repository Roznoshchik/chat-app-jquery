# Simple Chat app in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery

As part of a coding assignment, I was asked to build a simple chat application.

## Differences between main branch
The main branch doesn't have backend or a db. 
This branch uses a postgres database with a koa server. 

## Assignment Requirements

- Anything that could be jQuery should be in jQuery
- A page that opens in the browser and shows colored bubbles.
- computer generates random conversation
- user posts responses
- screen should automatically flow to the bottom. 
- each message should indicate date and time it was sent.

## Details

This took me around 30-35 hours to complete. I wasn't actually keeping track of time, but thinking through the timing, that feels pretty accurate. 

I had only known some very basic jQuery before this, so I wasn't familiar with the library.

I used SASS to write and compile my css code. 

The app won't render correctly on mobile as I did not add any affordances for screensizes outside of my 14" MBP. 

The application doesn't have any backend. Everything happens on the client side.

You can see a live version of this application at my site here: [code.rch.work/chat-app](https://code.rch.work/chat-app)
